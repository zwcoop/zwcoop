Hello, World!
My name is Zac Cooper and I'd like to welcome you to my GitHub repository.
I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics in what seems like another lifetime ago now and 
since have worked in several positions spanning multuple industies. 
I genuinely enjoy learning new things and aspire to be a lifetime learner.
I am currently learning to program and am considering pursuing a Masters in Computer Science.
Right now I'm focues on learning Python and Linux.
Please say hello!
